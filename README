Base configuration for a Docker instance

Use as a starting point for projects.

1. Edit the Dockerfile to add packages to be installed via apt-get
2. Edit requirements.txt and add packages to be installed by pip
3. Edit the Makefile to set the name of the image, and the program to run

Then type 'make .docker' to build the image, or just 'make' to build and run in one go.
